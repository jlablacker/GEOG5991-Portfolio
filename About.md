<h1>About Me</h1>

<h6>
My name is James Blacker, and I am a second year student here at the University of Leeds. Originally from London, I am currently living and working in the United States.  I have an undergraduate degree in geography and spent 6 years as a GIS analyst working with the US government as well as the telecommunications industry.  Currently, I don't code as much as I used to, having moved into the project management area, but I still manage GIS teams.
  
In my spare time, I volunteer with the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF). I also enjoy cooking, and travelling with my family.
