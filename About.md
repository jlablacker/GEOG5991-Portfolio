<h5>
<p>My name is James and I am a second year grad student here at the University of Leeds. Originally from South London, I am currently living and working in the United States.  I have an undergraduate degree in geography concentrating in GIS.  I spent 6 years as a GIS analyst working with the US government as well as the healthcare, and telecommunications industries.  
  
<p>Since 2012, I have been a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. My current role is in the IT project management area, and I have worked with GIS development teams. My current projects focus on improving geospatial data quality through automated rules-based logic.</p>
  
<p>In my spare time, I volunteer with the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF), helping with search and rescue and disaster relief operations. I also enjoy cooking, and travelling with my family.</p>
