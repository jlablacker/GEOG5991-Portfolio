<h4>Agent Based Model</h4>

<p>In an Agent Based Model, 'Agents' are entities given traits and initial behavior rules that organize their actions and interactions. Stochasticity can be included in the assignment of agent characteristics and in determining which agents interact and how agents obtain information and make decisions.</p>
