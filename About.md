<h1>About Me</h1>

<h6>
<p>My name is James and I am a second year grad student here at the University of Leeds. Originally from South London, I am currently living and working in the United States.  I have an undergraduate degree in geography concentrating in GIS. I spent 6 years as a GIS analyst working with the US government as well as the telecommunications industry.  Currently, I don't code as much as I used to, having moved into the project management area, but I still interact with GIS data daily.</p>
  
<p>In my spare time, I volunteer with the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF), helping with search and rescue and disaster relief operations. I also enjoy cooking, and travelling with my family.</p></h6>
