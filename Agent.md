<h1>Agent Based Model</h1>

In an Agent Based Model, 'Agents' are entities given traits and initial behavior rules that organize their actions and interactions. Stochasticity can be included in the assignment of agent characteristics and in determining which agents interact and how agents obtain information and make decisions.

The example model that I constructed should:

1. builds agents in a space;
2. gets them to interact with each other;
3. reads in environmental data;
4. gets agents to interact with the environment;
5. randomizes the order of agent actions;
6. plays the model as an animation;
7. is contained within a GUI;
8. is initialised with data from the web
